# Taxi-Fair-prediction-Model
Predicting Taxi fares before a customer books a ride for NewYorkTLC in a hypothetical situation
(Google Advanced data Analytics Certificate Course)

**SCENARIO**
For a hypothetical company named Automatidata, we are tasked with creating project proposal, PACE strategy documents, data preparation, data cleaning, EDA, model building and evaluation to create a predictive model for a company named NewYork TLC which predicts the fares of their taxi before a customer books one.
We analyze a hypothetical dataset provided within the course, analyze it, prepare it , perform EDA and proceed with model building and testing.

**RESOURCES**
- Python Version: 3.7
- Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Stage 1 (Project proposal)**
- Project proposal is made for the company
- A PACE strategy model has been developed

**Stage 2 (Data preperation/cleaning)**
- Basic data preparation is performed to describe the data and pre data cleaning stage is performed
- PACE strategy is updated
- Executive summary prepared to keep stakeholders upto date and help fellow co-workers (hypothetical) follow along easily

**Stage 3 (EDA)**
- I performed the practices of exploratory data analysis (EDA): - Discovery
                                                                - Structuring
                                                                - Cleaning
                                                                - Joining
                                                                - Validating
                                                                - Presenting
- Use of Tableau platform for data visualization/presentation

**Stage 4 (Hypothesis testing)**
- Analyzed and verified the results from an A/B test conducted by the company (Automatidata).
- Conducted a 2-sample t-test to verify if there is a statistical significance between the type of payment (eg.: credit card, cash, etc.) and fare amount.

**Stage 5 (Regression Analysis)**
- Identified the suitable variables for model develpoment.
- Selected a Multiple regression model to meet the skateholder needs.
- Implemented the regression model and provided skateholders with valuable insights using various interpretation means.
